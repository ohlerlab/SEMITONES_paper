# SEMITONES paper

## Description

This repository contains the analysis scripts and notebooks used to get the results presented in the [SEMITONES manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.386664v1.full) and [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac639). The SEMITONES repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ohlerlab/SEMITONES).

The data scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data used in these analyses is publically available from GEO series [GSE139369](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139369) (scRNA-seq) and the [Greenleaf lab GitHub page](https://github.com/GreenleafLab/MPAL-Single-Cell-2019) (scATAC-seq Hematopoeisis cell x peak Summarized Experiment) related to the original data publication [1].

The spatial gene expression data is available from [10X](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/datasets) or can be downloaded using [SeuratData](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data).
